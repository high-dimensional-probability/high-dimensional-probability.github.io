Consider the sets $$I_n = \set{t \in [0, 1] : \sin(2 \pi t / 2^{2-n}) \ge 0}$$ for $$n \ge 1$$ and $$I_0 = \varnothing$$:
\begin{equation}
    I_0 = \varnothing, \quad
    I_1 = [0, 1], \quad
    I_2 = [0, \tfrac 12], \quad
    I_3 = [0, \tfrac 14] \cup [\tfrac12,\tfrac34], \quad
    \ldots.
\end{equation}
For $$k$$ points, assign to every $$(I_i)_{i=0}^{2^k}$$ a subset of the $$k$$ points.
Then, by "tracing through the intervals", every point is uniquely assigned to an interval in the partition of $$[0, 1]$$ determined by $$I_{2^k}$$.
With these assignments, the function class shatters some $$k$$ points for all $$k \in \N$$, so the VC dimension is infinite.

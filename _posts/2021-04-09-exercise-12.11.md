Use the Multinomial theorem:
\begin{equation}
    k(x, y) = (1 + \lra{x, z})^m = \sum_{|\alpha|=m}\binom{m}{\alpha}(1, x \had z)^\alpha,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{d+1})$.
Use method of stars and bars to count numbers of terms:
There are $m$ stars and $(d + 1) - 1 = d$ bars, which gives a total of $d + m$ items,
and it suffices to choose the position the stars: a total of $\binom{d + m}{m}$ combinations.

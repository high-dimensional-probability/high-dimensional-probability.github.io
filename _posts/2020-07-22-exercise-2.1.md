> __Part (a).__
> Provide a non-negative random variable $$X$$ for which Markov's Inequality is met with equality.

Recall that Markov's Inequality can be derived as follows:
assuming that $$X\ge$$ almost surely,
\begin{equation}
    \P(X \ge a)
    = \frac1a \E[a\ind_{\set{X \ge a}}]
    \le \frac1a\E[X\ind_{\set{X \ge a}}]
    \le \frac1a \E[X].
\end{equation}
Hence, we have equality if $$a \ind_{\set{X \ge a}} = X$$ almost surely.
For example, this is the case when $$X \in \set{0, a}$$.

> __Part (b).__
> Provide a random variable $$Y$$ for which Chebyshev's Inequality is met with equality.

Similarly, for Chebyshev's Inequality, we have equality if $$(X - \E[X])^2 \in \set{0, a}$$.
This is the case when
\begin{equation}
    X = \begin{cases}
        2 \sqrt{a} & \text{with probability $\tfrac13$}, \newline
        \sqrt{a} & \text{with probability $\tfrac13$}, \newline
        0 & \text{with probability $\tfrac13$}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Then $$\E[X] = \sqrt{a}$$, so $$(X - \E[X])^2 \in \set{0, a}$$.

The standard basis can be clearly shattered, hence
$$\nu(\mathcal{S}_\text{left}^d) \geq d$$.
On the other hand, consider any collection of $$d + 1$$ _distinct_ points.
Take $$M_j = \max_{i \in [d + 1]} x_{i j}$$ (maximum over the $$j^\text{th}$$
coordinate among the $$d+1$$ points), we consider the following two cases:
(i) there is a point $$x_i$$ such that $$x_{ij} < M_j$$ for all $$j \in [d]$$,
and (ii) there is no such point.

If (i) is the case, the point $$x_i$$ can never have zero label on its own.
If (ii) is the case, there must be at least two points $$x_{i} \neq x_{i'}$$
such that $$x_{ij} = x_{i'j}$$ for some j, and it will be impossible to assign
$$+1$$ label to all but exactly one of those points. Combined with the above
lower bound, we thus have $$\nu(\mathcal{S}_\text{left}^d) = d$$.

The bound $$|\mathcal{S}_\text{left}^d (x_1^n)| \leq (n + 1)^d$$
then follows by Proposition 4.18 (Vapnik--Chervonenkis, Sauer and Shelah).

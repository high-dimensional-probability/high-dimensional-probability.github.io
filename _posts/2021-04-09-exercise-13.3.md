From Example 12.7, we know that $k(x, y)$ is a kernel for $\Hb_0^2[0, 1]$, the collection of functions $f\colon [0, 1] \to \R$ that are $\alpha$-times differentiable almost everywhere with (1) $f^{\prime\prime}$ Lebesgue-integrable and (2) the constraint that $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$.
The example also shows that
\begin{equation}
    \lra{f, g}_k = \int\_0^1 f^{\prime\prime}(x)g^{\prime\prime}(x) \isd x.
\end{equation}
Due to the requirement $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$, the only linear function that $\Hb\_0^2[0, 1]$ contains is the zero function.
Therefore, every function in $f \in \Hb^2[0, 1]$ can uniquely be additively decomposed in terms of a linear function and a function $f\_0 \in \Hb\_0^2[0, 1]$.
Moreover,
\begin{equation}
    \int\_0^1 (f^{\prime\prime}(x))^2 \isd x = \norm{f\_0}\_{k}^2.
\end{equation}
The parts therefore follow from the usual representer argument.

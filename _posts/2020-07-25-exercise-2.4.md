Consider a random variable $$ X $$ with mean $$ \mu = \E [X] $$, and such that,
for some scalars $$ b > a, X \in [a, b] $$ almost surely.

> __Part (a).__
> Defining the function $$ \psi(\lambda) = \log \E[e^{\lambda X}] $$, show that
> $$ \psi (0) = 0 $$ and $$ \psi'(0) = \mu $$.

To begin with, $$ \psi(0) = \log 1 = 0 $$.
For $$ \psi'(0) $$, we know that the derivative of the MGF equals $$ \mu $$, so
\begin{equation}
  \psi'(0) = \frac{\mu}{\E [e^{0 X}]} = \mu \,.
\end{equation}

> __Part (b).__
> Show that $$ \psi'' (\lambda) = \E_\lambda[X^2] âˆ’ (E_\lambda [X])^2 $$,
> where we define
> $$ \E_\lambda [f(X)] := \frac{\E[ f(X)e^{\lambda X} ]}{\E [e^{\lambda X}]} $$.
>  Use this fact to obtain an upper bound on
> $$ \sup_{\lambda \in \R} | \psi'' (\lambda) | $$.

The identity for $$ \psi''(\lambda) $$ follows from the chain rule.
For the upper bound, observe that we can define a new distribution
$$ Q_\lambda $$ by taking
$$ e^{\lambda X} \, / \, \E [ e^{\lambda X} ] $$
<!-- $$ \frac{e^{\lambda X}}{\E [ e^{\lambda X} ]} $$ -->
to be its Radon-Nikodym derivative (density) with respect to the distribution
of $$ X $$.
Hence establishing a bound on $$\psi''(\lambda)$$ is equivalent to bounding the
supremum over variances of random variables $$ X_\lambda \sim Q_\lambda $$.

Taking $$ m := \frac{1}{2}(a + b) $$, using that the mean minimises the mean squared error,
and using that $$ X_\lambda \in [a, b] $$ a.s. for all $$ \lambda $$,
\begin{align}
  \sup_\lambda \V (X_\lambda)
  = \sup_\lambda \E [ (X_\lambda - \E[X_\lambda])^2 ]
  \leq \sup_\lambda \E [ (X_\lambda - m)^2 ]
  \leq
  (b - m)^2
  =
  \frac{(b - a)^2}{4}
  \, .
\end{align}


> __Part (c).__
> Use parts (a) and (b) to establish that $$ X $$ is sub-Gaussian with parameter
>  at most $$ \sigma = \frac{b - a}{2} $$.

Taking a Taylor expansion of $$ \psi(\lambda) $$ at
$$ \lambda = 0 $$,
\begin{align}
  \psi(\lambda)
  =
  \psi(0) + \lambda \psi'(0) + \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \psi''(\e) \, ,
\end{align}
for some $$ \e \in (0, \lambda) $$.
Substituting the results from (a) and (b),
$$ \psi(\lambda) \leq \lambda \mu + \frac{1}{8} \lambda^2 (b - a)^2$$ as desired.

Consider a random variable $$ X $$ with mean $$ \mu = \E [X] $$, and such that,
for some scalars $$ b > a, X \in [a, b] $$ almost surely.

## (a)

To begin with, $$ \psi(0) = \log 1 = 0 $$.
For $$ \psi'(0) $$, we know that the derivative of the MGF equals $$ \mu $$, so

\begin{equation}
    \psi'(0) = \frac{\mu}{\E [e^{0 X}]} = \mu \,.
\end{equation}

## (b)

The identity for $$ \psi''(\lambda) $$ follows from the chain rule.
For the upper bound, observe that we can define a new distribution
$$ Q_\lambda $$ by taking
$$ e^{\lambda X} \, / \, \E [ e^{\lambda X} ] $$
<!-- $$ \frac{e^{\lambda X}}{\E [ e^{\lambda X} ]} $$ -->
to be its Radon-Nikodym derivative (density) with respect to the distribution
of $$ X $$.
Hence establishing a bound on $$\psi''(\lambda)$$ is equivalent to bounding the
supremum over variances of random variables $$ X_\lambda \sim Q_\lambda $$.

Taking $$ m := \frac{1}{2}(a + b) $$, using that the mean minimises the mean squared error,
and using that $$ X_\lambda \in [a, b] $$ a.s. for all $$ \lambda $$,

\begin{equation}
    \sup_\lambda \V (X_\lambda)
    = \sup_\lambda \E [ (X_\lambda - \E[X_\lambda])^2 ]
    \leq \sup_\lambda \E [ (X_\lambda - m)^2 ]
    \leq
    (b - m)^2
    =
    \frac{(b - a)^2}{4}
    \, .
\end{equation}

## (c)

Taking a Taylor expansion of $$ \psi(\lambda) $$ at
$$ \lambda = 0 $$,

\begin{equation}
    \psi(\lambda)
    =
    \psi(0) + \lambda \psi'(0) + \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \psi''(\e) \, ,
\end{equation}

for some $$ \e \in (0, \lambda) $$.
Substituting the results from (a) and (b),
$$ \psi(\lambda) \leq \lambda \mu + \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \frac{(b - a)^2}{4}$$ as desired.

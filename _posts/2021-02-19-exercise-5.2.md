\begin{align}
  M(2 \delta)
  \overset{\text{(a)}}{\leq}
  N(\delta)
  \overset{\text{(b)}}{\leq}
  M(\delta)
\end{align}

## (a)

Since
$$d(\theta, \theta') \leq d(\theta, \theta_i) + d(\theta', \theta_i) \leq 2 \delta$$
if $$\theta, \theta'$$ lie within a $$\delta$$-ball around $$\theta_i$$, at most
one member of any particular $$(2\delta)$$-packing can lie within each of the
$$\delta$$-balls around the $$N(\delta)$$ points forming the
$$\delta$$-covering.

## (b)

If there is a point $$\theta$$ with $$d(\theta, \theta_i) > \delta$$ for each
$$\theta_i$$ constituting a $$\delta$$-packing, than
$$\lbrace \theta \rbrace \cup \lbrace \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n \rbrace$$ is
still a $$\delta$$-packing. Hence any _maximal_ $$\delta$$-packing must also be
a $$\delta$$-covering.

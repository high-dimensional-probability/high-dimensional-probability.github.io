Since $$\E [(Q - \E[Q])^2] = \E [Q^2] - (\E[Q])^2$$, and $$(Q - \E[Q])^2$$ is
positive semidefinite, the result follows by the fact that positive semidefinite
matrices form a _closed_ convex cone (see, e.g., theorem 3.1
[here](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hf323/lent2017_topics_convex_optimisation/lecture3.pdf)),
and the expectation can be expressed as a limit of convex combinations.

Define $$\tau \subset \N$$ to be the set of indices associated with members
of an $$s$$-clique, $$v^\top A v = s$$ for
$$v_i = \frac{\ind_{i \in \tau}}{\sqrt{s}}$$, implying $$\|A\|_2 \geq s$$.

For the upper bound, take $$v$$ to an eigenvector such that
$$\| A v \|_2 = \| A \|_2$$, and $$i$$ to be an index for
which $$|v_i| = \| v \|_\infty$$. Then
\begin{align}
  \\| A \\|\_2 |v\_i|
  =
  | [A v]\_i |
  \leq
  \\| A v \\|\_\infty
  \leq
  \\| A \\|\_\infty |v\_i|
  \, .
\end{align}
Since $$v \neq 0$$, the above implies $$\| A \|_2 \leq \| A \|_\infty$$.
We conclude by observing $$\| A \|_\infty = \max_i \| A_{i \cdot} \| = s$$
which follows by the assumed maximum degree $$s - 1$$ (remember $$A$$ is
defined with ones on the diagonal here).

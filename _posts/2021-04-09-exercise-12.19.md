## (a)
Obvious: any finite product and sum of PSD kernels is a PSD kernel.

## (b)
Use series expansion of the exponential function and the fact that a pointwise limit of PSD kernels is also a PSD kernel.

## (c)
Expand the square and use (b):
\begin{equation}
    k(x, z)
    = e^{-\tfrac12\norm{x - z}^2}
    = e^{-\tfrac12\norm{x}^2} e^{-\tfrac12\norm{z}^2} e^{\lra{x, z}^2}.
\end{equation}

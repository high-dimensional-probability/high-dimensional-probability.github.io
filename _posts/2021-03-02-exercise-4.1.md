## (a)
Let $$\gamma$$ be a functional that is continuous in $$\norm{\vardot}_\infty$$ at $$F$$.
By the Glivenko--Cantelli theorem, $$\norm{\hat F_n - F}_\infty \to 0$$ almost surely, so $$\abs{\gamma(F_n) - \gamma(F)} \to 0$$ almost surely, hence also in probability.

## (b)
### (i)
The mean functional is *not* continuous.
Consider $$F = \ind_{[0, \infty)}$$ and
\begin{equation}
    F_n
    =
        \parens{1 - \tfrac{1}{n}} \ind_{[0, \infty)}
        +  \tfrac{1}{n} \ind_{[n, \infty)}.
\end{equation}
Then $$F$$ has mean $$0$$, $$F_n$$ has mean $$1$$, and $$\norm{F - F_n}_\infty \to 0$$.

### (ii)
The CramÃ©r--von Mises function is continuous.
For this, see that
\begin{equation}
    (F - F_0)^2 - (G - F_0)^2
    = (F + G)(F - G) - 2F_0(F - G)
    \le 4 \norm{F - G}_\infty
    \to 0.
\end{equation}

### (iii)
The quantile function is also continuous, but only from above.
Note that $$\norm{F - F_n}_\infty \le \delta$$ implies that
\begin{equation}
    F_n(t) \ge \alpha \implies F(t) \ge \alpha - \delta.
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    \set{t : F_n(t) \ge \alpha} \subseteq \set{t : F(t) \ge \alpha - \delta}
    \implies
    Q_{\alpha}(F_n) \ge Q_{\alpha - \delta}(F) \ge Q_\alpha(F) - \e
\end{equation}
where $$\e$$ can be made arbitrarily small by making $$\delta$$ small, uniformly over $$F_n$$, using left continuity of $$\alpha \mapsto Q_\alpha(F)$$.
Therefore, $$Q_\alpha(F) - Q_\alpha(F_n) \le \e$$ for all $$F_n$$.
If we further assume that $$F_n \ge F$$ for all $$F_n$$, then we conclude that $$\abs{Q_\alpha(F) - Q_\alpha(F_n)} \le \e$$ for all $$F_n$$.

For completeness, we also show that $$\alpha \mapsto Q_\alpha(F)$$ is left continuous.
Let $$\e > 0$$ and set $$t = Q_\alpha(F)$$.
Consider $$t - \e < t$$.
By definition of $$t$$, then $$F(t - \e) < \alpha$$.
Therefore, using right continuity of $$F$$, we can find a $$t'$$ such that $$F(t - \e) < F(t') = \alpha' < \alpha$$.
Intuitively, we then wrap up by using that $$F$$ is increasing: $$t - \e < t'$$.
More precisely, by $$F(t - \e) < \alpha'$$ and definition of $$Q_{\alpha'}(F)$$, we conclude that $$t - \e \le Q_{\alpha'}(F)$$.

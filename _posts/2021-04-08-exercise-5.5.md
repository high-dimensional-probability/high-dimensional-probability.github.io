## (a)
If $w_i \sim \Normal(0, 1)$, then $w_i = \e_i r_i$ where $\e_i \sim \Rad(\tfrac12)$ and $r_i$ is a half-Gaussian random variable.
Consider
\begin{equation}
    \phi(r) = \E[\,\sup_{\theta \in \Tb}\,\lra{\theta, r \had \e}],
\end{equation}
which we note is a convex function.
Then, by Jensen's Inequality,
\begin{equation}
    \G(\Tb) = \E[\phi(r)] \ge \phi(\E[r]) = \E[r_1] \phi(1) = \sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} \Rc(\Tb).
\end{equation}
Equality is achieved at $\set{-1, 1}$.

## (b)
Consider the function
\begin{equation}
    \psi_r(\theta) = \frac{r \had \theta}{\max_{i \in [d]}\abs{r_i}},
\end{equation}
which we note is a contraction.
Then, assuming the contraction inequality for the Rademacher complexity, we have
\begin{equation}
    \Rc(\psi_r(\Tb)) \le \Rc(\Tb)
    \implies
    \phi(r) \le \parens{\max\_{i \in [d]}\,\abs{r_i}} \Rc(\Tb).
\end{equation}
Take expectations to conclude:
\begin{equation}
    \G(\Tb)
    = \E[\phi(r)]
    \le \E\sbrac{\max_{i \in [d]}\,\abs{r_i}} \Rc(\Tb)
    \le 2 \sqrt{\log d}\, \Rc(\Tb).
\end{equation}

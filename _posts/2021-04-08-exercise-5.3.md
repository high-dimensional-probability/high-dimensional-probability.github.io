Consider a $\delta$-packing.
Then the $\tfrac12 \delta$-balls do not intersect.
Hence, the total number of elements in the union of those balls is at most $2^d$:
\begin{equation}
    M \sum_{i=1}^{\delta d} \binom{d}{i} \le 2^d
    \iff
    \log M
    \le - \log \sum_{i=1}^{\delta d} \binom{d}{i} 2^{-d}
    = - \log \P(Z_d \le \tfrac12 \delta d)
\end{equation}
where $Z_d$ is the sum of $d$ $\Ber(\tfrac12)$ variables.
Therefore, by the lower bound from [Exercise 2.10]({% post_url 2020-08-24-exercise-2.10 %}),
\begin{equation}
    \frac1d \log M \le \KL\parens{
        \tfrac12 \delta, \tfrac12
    } + \frac1d \log(d + 1).
\end{equation}

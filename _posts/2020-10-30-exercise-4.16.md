Take [regular nonagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonagon) and $$x_1$$ to
$$x_9$$ to be its nine vertices.  Observe that different labelings of these
points can be represented 4-gons inscribed to the circle on which the nonagon
lies. Importantly, whenever any point and its clockwise[^1] neighbour are
to have a different label, one side of the 4-gon has to be placed between
them. In other words, only the assignments in which the number of points with
clockwise neighbour of different label is less than four are realisable by
4-gons in $$\R^2$$. We will therefore be able to shatter all the
$$2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9$$ points, where the $$+1$$ comes from the fact that the
$$9^\text{th}$$ point will always have the same label as one of its neighbours,
and thus we can relabel it as the $$1^\text{st}$$ point when needed.

An analogous argument shows that we can shatter at most $$9$$ points which lie
on a circle (to which the regular nonagon is inscribed), or more generally
on the convex hull of all the points. Hence the only way for $$10$$ or more
points to be shattered by 4-gons in $$\R^2$$ is for at least one point $$x$$ to
be a convex combination of the others. However, then there will be a labelling
which assigns zero to $$x$$, and one to at least two points of which $$x$$ is
a convex combination, such that separating the three points will require two
sides of the polygon; the remaining seven points can then be assigned
an alternating zero-one pattern which together with the two sides separating
$$x$$ cannot form a 4-gon.


[^1]: We could have equally well used counter-clockwise.

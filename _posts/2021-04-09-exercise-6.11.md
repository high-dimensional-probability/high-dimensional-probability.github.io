## (a)
We verify the Bernstein condition for $g_i Q_i$:
\begin{align}
    \E[(g_i Q_i)^j]
    \le \frac{j!}{2} (b_1 b_2)^{j-2} \sigma^2 b_2^2 I
\end{align}
with $\V[g_i Q_i] \le \sigma^2 b_2^2$.
Hence, we can use a one-sided version of the Bernstein bound for matrices to deduce concentration for $\lambda_1(g_i Q_i)$.
To conclude, note that $\lambda_1(g_i Q_i) = \sigma_1(g_i A_i) = \norm{g_i A_i}_2$, because the eigenvalues of $Q_i$ are symmetric (if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, then $-\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue).

## (b)
Follows immediately.

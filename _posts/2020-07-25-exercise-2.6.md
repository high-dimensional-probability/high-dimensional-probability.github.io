Dividing by $$ \sigma^2 $$, we can w.l.o.g. take $$ \sigma = 1 $$.
Then by Proposition 2.14 (resp. Equation (2.23)) in the book, it is sufficient
to show $$ \E [X^4] \leq 8 $$ for $$ X = X_1 $$.
Using the *layered cake* trick,

\begin{equation}
    \E [X^4]
    =
    \int_0^\infty \P (X^4 \geq s) \, \sd s
    \overset{s = t^4}{=}
    \int_0^\infty 4 t^3 \P (|X| \geq t) \, \sd t
    \leq
    8 \int_0^\infty t^3 e^{-t^2 / 2} \, \sd t
    =
    16
    \, .
\end{equation}

    The above derivation is valid but yields a **worse constant than required!**

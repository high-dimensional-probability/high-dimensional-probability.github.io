Suppose that $\mathbb{G}$ is a closed linear subspace.
For some $f$, let $g$ to be the projection onto $\mathbb{G}$.
Define $g_\parallel := g$ and $g_\perp := f - g$.
Then $f = g_\parallel + g_\perp$.
We claim that $g_\perp \in \mathbb{G}^\perp$.
For suppose not: $\lra{f - g, v} > 0$ for some $v \in \mathbb{G}$.
Then $v \in \mathbb{G}$ is positively correlated with the remainder, so we should be able to add a little to reduce the norm.
In particular, we can show that
$
    \norm{f - (g + t v)}^2 < \norm{f - g}^2
$
for a sufficiently small $t > 0$, which contradicts the definition of $g$.
Moreover, it is true that the decomposition $f = g_\parallel + g_\perp$ is unique.
This proves that $\Hb = \mathbb{G} \oplus \mathbb{G}^\perp$ for every closed linear subspace $\mathbb{G}$.
